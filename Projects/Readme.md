#### Instructions:
  - The project aims to train a superior classification model.
    - All steps in an ML pipeline must be followed. 
    - All problems, we deal with during the semester, must be highlighted with solutions (e.g., imbalancedness, etc.)
  - The final project submissions consist of a report and a presentation.
    - The report must include all the details of the steps with codes and comments.
    - Each group must prepare a repo in GitHub (or any other) that consists of all materials to reproduce the results in the project. 
  - Each group presents their project for 5 mins in the evaluations.


# Projects:

#### Task 1 - Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction) - Elif KARTAL 
  - The target is to predict whether a passenger is satisfied or not.
  - Use at least 2K observations for training the ML model (Your dataset consists of 26K observations, it may not be possible to run such big data on your computer).

#### Task 2 - Prediction of Goals in European Football (https://jaseziv.github.io/worldfootballR/articles/load-scraped-data.html) - Sezai Ufuk ORAL & Emre ÇORBACI
  - Use Understat League Shots.
  - The target is whether a shot is a goal.

#### Task 3 - Predictive Maintenance (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification) - Yiğitcan YARDIMCI & Berke KAYGISIZ
  - Use at least 2K observations for training the ML model (if possible use all the observations).

#### Task 4 - AIDS Virus Infection Prediction (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadarshvelu/aids-virus-infection-prediction) - Ümmü SAVRAN & Ezo YEDİGÖL
  - Target is whether a patient is infected with AIDS.
